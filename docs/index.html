                Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen.
                For by it our ancestors were approved.
                By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen has been made from things that are not visible.
                By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain [did]. By this he was approved as a righteous man, because God approved his gifts, and even though he is dead, he still speaks through this. By faith, Enoch was taken away so that he did not experience death, and he was not to be found because God took him away. For prior to his transformation he was approved, having pleased God.

                He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.
                He renews my life; He leads me along the right paths for His name's sake.
                Even when I go through the darkest valley, I fear [no] danger, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff --they comfort me.
                You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
                Only goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD as long as I live.

                He did not even spare His own Son, but offered Him up for us all; how will He not also with Him grant us everything?
                Who can bring an accusation against God's elect? God is the One who justifies.
                Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the One who died, but even more, has been raised; He also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us.

Yes, Father, because this was Your good pleasure.
All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal Him.
